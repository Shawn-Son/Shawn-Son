## About Me

**Data-driven explorer building the future with machine learning and analytics.**

Hi, Iâ€™m Son!  
Iâ€™m a **Masterâ€™s student in Data Science** at the University of Michigan.  
My passion is **data-driven discovery** and **intelligent automation**.

Previously, I worked at **SeoulTechâ€™s Industrial AI Lab**, applying machine learning to real-world problems.

---

**Main focus areas**
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**
- Predictive modeling
- Pattern discovery in complex datasets

---

I enjoy  
- Solving tough problems  
- Learning new skills  
- Collaborating with others who love technology and innovation
